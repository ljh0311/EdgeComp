# Baby Monitor System - Utility Scripts

The following utility scripts are available to help manage the Baby Monitor System.

## Backup and Restore

### Using Backup and Restore Tool

The Baby Monitor System includes a backup and restore utility to help safeguard your configuration and data.

To use this tool:
```
tools\backup_restore.bat    # Windows
# OR
bash tools/backup/restore.sh  # Linux/MacOS
```

Options:
1. **List backup folders** - View all available backups
2. **Create a new backup** - Create a timestamped backup of your current system
3. **Restore from backup** - Restore your system to a previous state
4. **Clean up old backups** - Remove old backups, keeping only the most recent ones

### About Backup Folders

The folders named `backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` (e.g., `backup_20250327_011217`) are automatically generated by the system's backup mechanism. They contain copies of the system's state at the time specified in their name.

#### Managing Backups

- **Keep** at least the 3 most recent backups for recovery purposes
- **Delete** older backups automatically using the cleanup option
- **Restore** from a backup if you encounter issues

## Platform-Specific Tools

### Raspberry Pi Optimization

If you're running the Baby Monitor on a Raspberry Pi, you can optimize its performance:

```bash
# Run as root for full optimizations
sudo bash tools/system/optimize_raspberry_pi.sh
```

This script:
- Sets the CPU governor to performance mode
- Optimizes GPU memory allocation
- Improves swap configuration

## Testing Tools

### API Testing

Test the Baby Monitor's API endpoints:

```
python tests/updated/api_test.py
```

Add additional parameters to test a different host or port:
```
python tests/updated/api_test.py [host] [port]
```

## Directory Structure
