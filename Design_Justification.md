## 1. Introduction

The Edge Computing Baby Monitor project is an intelligent monitoring system that leverages edge computing technology to provide real-time baby monitoring capabilities. The system combines advanced computer vision, audio processing, and machine learning techniques to offer comprehensive monitoring features including person detection, emotion recognition, and sound analysis. By processing data at the edge (locally), the system ensures low-latency responses and enhanced privacy while providing a modern web-based interface for convenient monitoring.

## 2. Problem Statement

### Background/Relevance

Traditional baby monitors are limited to basic audio/video streaming without intelligent monitoring capabilities. With the advancement of edge computing and AI technologies, there's an opportunity to create smarter monitoring systems that can actively detect and alert caregivers about potential safety concerns while ensuring data privacy and real-time responsiveness.

### Aim

To develop an intelligent edge-based baby monitoring system that provides real-time detection, emotion recognition, and alerts while maintaining data privacy and low latency.

### Objectives

- Implement real-time person detection and tracking using edge-optimized AI models
- Develop audio processing for sound classification and emotion recognition
- Create a responsive and intuitive web interface for monitoring
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Raspberry Pi)
- Maintain data privacy through local processing
- Provide real-time alerts and status updates
