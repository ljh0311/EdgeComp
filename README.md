# Edge Computing Baby Monitor

An intelligent baby monitoring system that combines real-time cry analysis and person detection using edge computing technology.

## Overview

This project implements a smart baby monitor that helps parents and caregivers by:
- Detecting and tracking the baby's position in real-time
- Analyzing baby cries to identify potential causes (hunger, discomfort, tiredness)
- Monitoring room occupancy through person detection
- Operating effectively in various lighting conditions, including night time
- Processing all data locally on the edge device for enhanced privacy
