## Installation

### Windows Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/edge-computing-baby-monitor.git
cd edge-computing-baby-monitor
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download YOLOv8 model:

```bash
mkdir models
# Download YOLOv8 nano model to models directory
curl -L https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov8n.pt -o models/yolov8n.pt
```

### Raspberry Pi 400 Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/edge-computing-baby-monitor.git
cd edge-computing-baby-monitor
```

2. Run the installation script:

```bash
chmod +x install_pi.sh
./install_pi.sh
```

The installation script will:

- Install system dependencies
- Set up the camera module
- Create Python virtual environment
- Install optimized Python packages
- Download required models
- Configure environment variables

## Usage

### Running on Windows

1. Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Run in production mode (status and alerts only):

```bash
python src/main.py
```

3. Run in developer mode (with video feed and waveform):

```bash
python src/main.py --dev
```

### Running on Raspberry Pi 400

1. Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Run in production mode:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

3. Run in developer mode:

```bash
python src/main.py --dev
```

### Accessing the Web Interface

The web interface will be available at:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

For remote access within your local network, use your device's IP address:

```
http://<device-ip>:5000
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `CAMERA_INDEX`: Camera device index (default: 0)
- `USE_CUDA`: Enable CUDA acceleration on Windows (default: 0)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (default: INFO)

### Performance Settings

#### Windows

- Frame rate: 30 FPS
- Detection interval: 1 second
- Full visualization enabled

#### Raspberry Pi 400

- Frame rate: 15 FPS
- Detection interval: 2 seconds
- Visualization disabled
- Frame skipping enabled
- Reduced audio chunk size
- Limited thread pool

## Troubleshooting

### Windows

1. Camera not detected:
   - Check camera connection
   - Try different `CAMERA_INDEX` values
   - Verify camera works in other applications

2. Performance issues:
   - Close resource-intensive applications
   - Reduce resolution in config.py
   - Disable developer mode

### Raspberry Pi 400

1. Camera issues:
   - Run `sudo modprobe bcm2835-v4l2`
   - Check camera connection
   - Verify camera module is enabled in raspi-config

2. Performance optimization:
   - Monitor temperature: `vcgencmd measure_temp`
   - Check CPU usage: `top`
   - Ensure active cooling
   - Reduce resolution if needed

3. Audio issues:
   - Check audio device: `arecord -l`
   - Test microphone: `arecord -D plughw:1,0 test.wav`
   - Verify audio permissions
